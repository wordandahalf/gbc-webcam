### gbc-webcam
A color webcam made using the M64282FP silicon retina found in the Gameboy Camera. It is under active development, aiming to use three separate sensors and a dichroic prism for color sensitivity. A realtime temporal demosaicking algorithm leverages the separate sensors for increased framerate.
